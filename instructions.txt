If you get an error during the first run, you also need to install `nltk.tokenize.punkt`:
For this, Run this once in your terminal:
    $ python
    >>> import nltk
    >>> nltk.download('punkt')


## Usage
Run : python train.py

This will train the model with training data(i.e. intents.json) and will dump `data.pth` file.
And then run : python app.py

Then ChatBot will start running.
